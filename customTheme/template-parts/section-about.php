            <p class="about__description">
              <span>The N95 mask</span> is a form of respiratory protective wear
              worn over the nose and mouth to help minimise the chance of
              inhaling airborne particles like viruses and other germs. It is a
              disposable mask made from synthetic polymer fibres produced in a
              highly specialised process called melt blowing. During this
              process, the inner layer of the N95 mask is created which forms
              the filtration layer capable of filtering out at
              <span>least 95%</span> of airborne particles when worn correctly.

              During outbreaks of respiratory illnesses and during periods of
              intense air pollution, wearing <span>N95 masks</span> has been
              shown to help reduce the inhalation of compromised air, filtering
              out nasty pathogens which lead to illness or which can aggravate
              existing respiratory problems. Maintaining clear and unhindered
              respiration is vitally important for remaining fit and healthy and
              people with pre-existing conditions or respiratory fragility can
              particularly benefit from wearing face masks while they are out in
              public and unable to control the breathing environments that they
              find themselves in.

              N95 Respirators In Industrial And Health Care Settings
            </h2>
            <p class="about__description">
              Most <span>N95 respirators</span> are manufactured for use in
              construction and other industrial type jobs that expose workers to
              dust and small particles. They are regulated by the National
              Personal Protective Technology Laboratory (NPPTL) in the National
              Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), which is
              part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

            <p class="about__description">
              However, some N95 respirators are intended for use in a health
              care setting. Specifically, single-use, disposable respiratory
              protective devices used and worn by health care personnel during
              procedures to protect both the patient and health care personnel
              from the transfer of microorganisms, body fluids, and particulate
              material. These surgical N95 respirators are class II devices
              regulated by the FDA, under 21 CFR 878.4040, and CDC NIOSH under
              42 CFR Part 84.
